# **Charlotte LYNX Light Rail & Bus Accessibility Analysis**  

## **Abstract**  
Charlotteâ€™s rapid population growth demands an efficient and equitable public transportation system. This project examines current and proposed **LYNX light rail** and **CATS bus** routes to evaluate **accessibility**, **service distribution**, and **equity impacts**. Using **ArcGIS mapping**, **clustering analysis**, and **statistical tests**, we assess whether planned expansions address mobility needs while promoting inclusive urban development.

## **Data**  
- **Source:** [City of Charlotte Open Data Portal](https://data.charlottenc.gov/)  
- **Content:**  
  - Station coordinates and route alignments  
  - ParknRide and BikeLocker availability  
  - LYNX Blue, Gold, and Silver Lines  
  - CATS bus routes  

---

## **Methods**  
- Spatial mapping and cluster analysis in **ArcGIS**  
- **Chi-Square** and **Kruskal-Wallis** tests to compare accessibility features  
- **Correlation analysis** of parking capacity and multimodal amenities  

---

## **Results**  
- Proposed stations **cluster in high-growth, high-income areas**, potentially limiting equity benefits  
- **ParknRide** and **BikeLocker** access remain unevenly distributed  
- No statistically significant difference in ParknRide availability between current and proposed Blue Line stations

## **Implications**  
Findings highlight the need for **expansion planning** that incorporates **demographic** and **ridership** data to ensure **equitable access** and improved mobility outcomes.
